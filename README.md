<h1>Island Invasion</h1>
This project houses the code used for a DarkBasic video game (made during an BTEC IT course at Priestley College). The aim of this game is to launch missiles at enemy fighter jets whilst avoiding their missiles. To check out this game for yourself, obtain a copy of <a href="https://github.com/TheGameCreators/Dark-Basic-Pro">DarkBasic</a> as a ZIP file and clone this repository. Extract it and go to the install folder and double-click the launch executible. When the IDE is open, select file > open > project. Locate the game code you downloaded and select the <code>dbpro</code> file. Press F5 to run the code. You may need to adjust some of the settings in the properties tab on the left.
